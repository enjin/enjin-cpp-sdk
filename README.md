## Compatibility

The Enjin C++ SDK is a C++17 library and is developed with cross-platform usage in mind. Platform and compiler
combinations tested are as follows:

* GCC 9.3.0 on Linux (64-bit)
* Clang 10.0.0 on Linux (64-bit)
* MSVC 2019 on Windows 10 (64-bit)

## Installation

The SDK may be built as a static or shared (dynamic) library. Use the `ENJINSDK_BUILD_SHARED` CMake argument to build as
a shared library and set it to "on" (off by default).

The following dependencies are used for building the SDK:

* [CMake (3.16+)](https://cmake.org/) as a build tool

The following libraries are used by the SDK for some of its functionality and must be locatable by CMake's
`find_package()` function, however these libraries are not necessary to link to your own target to use this SDK:

* [RapidJSON (1.1.0+)](https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson) for processing JSON
* [spdlog (1.8.0+)](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) for the logger class
* (optional) [cpp-httplib (0.8.5+)](https://github.com/yhirose/cpp-httplib) for a default HTTP client implementation
  * [openssl (1.1.1)](https://github.com/openssl/openssl) for HTTPS support
* (optional) [IXWebSocket (11.0.4+)](https://github.com/machinezone/IXWebSocket) for a default websocket client
  implementation

To have the SDK build its default HTTP and websocket clients use the `ENJINSDK_BUILD_DEFAULT_HTTP` and
`ENJINSDK_BUILD_DEFAULT_WEBSOCKET` as CMake arguments and set them to be "on" (off by default).

To utilize this SDK you may clone it into your project tree with:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/enjin/Enjin-CPP-SDK.git
```

Then use the following in your project's CMakeLists file:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(Enjin-CPP-SDK)
target_link_libraries(my_target PRIVATE enjinsdk::enjinsdk)
```

#### Linux

Alternatively, on Linux you may include the SDK in your project by cloning and building it with the following commands:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/enjin/Enjin-CPP-SDK.git
$ cmake ./Enjin-CPP-SDK [options] && make -j -C ./Enjin-CPP-SDK
```

From here, you may use CMake's `find_package()` function to find `enjinsdk` and link the library, `enjinsdk::enjinsdk`
to your target.

### Tests

For running unit tests [Git (1.6.5+)](https://git-scm.com/) is required to run CMake's `ExternalProject_Add()` function
to acquire [Googletest (1.10.0+)](https://github.com/google/googletest) to be used as the testing framework.

To have the test executable built, set the CMake argument `ENJINSDK_BUILD_TESTS` to `ON` and leave the `BUILD_TESTING`
option from CTest enabled.

## Quick Start

This example showcases how to quickly create and authenticate a client on the project schema which will then allow us to
make further requests to the platform.

```c++
#include "enjinsdk/EnjinHosts.hpp"
#include "enjinsdk/ProjectClient.hpp"
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

using namespace enjin::sdk;
using namespace enjin::sdk::graphql;
using namespace enjin::sdk::models;
using namespace enjin::sdk::project;

int main() {
    // Builds the project client to run on the Kovan test network.
    // See: https://kovan.cloud.enjin.io to sign up for the test network.
    std::unique_ptr<ProjectClient> client = ProjectClientBuilder()
        .base_uri(KOVAN) // From EnjinHosts
        .build();

    // Creates the request to authenticate the client.
    // Replace the appropriate strings with the project's UUID and secret.
    AuthProject req = AuthProject()
        .set_uuid("<the-project's-uuid>")
        .set_secret("<the-project's-secret>");

    // Sends the request to the platform and gets the response.
    GraphqlResponse<AccessToken> res = client->auth_project(req).get();

    // Checks if the request was successful.
    if (!res.is_successful()) {
        std::cout << "AuthProject request failed" << std::endl;
        return 0;
    }

    // Authenticates the client with the access token in the response.
    client->auth(res.get_result().value().get_token().value());

    // Checks if the client was authenticated.
    if (client->is_authenticated()) {
        std::cout << "Client is now authenticated" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Client was not authenticated" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Contributing

Contributions to the SDK are appreciated!

### Issues

You can open issues for bugs and enhancement requests.

When reporting bugs, please state the OS, compiler, and CMake arguments used as well as reproducible examples if
possible.

### Pull Requests

If you make any changes or improvements to the SDK, which you believe are beneficial to others, consider making a pull
request to merge your changes to be included in the next release.

Ensure that tests are passing when running the target `enjinsdk_tests` and add any necessary test classes or test cases
for your code.
